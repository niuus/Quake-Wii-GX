## **_INSTRUCTIONS_**
Extract the downloaded file into the _Apps_ folder in the root of your SD card.

If you don't own the full version, the shareware version with _PAK0.PAK_ is also available for download here _**(Quake_shareware.zip)**_. If you own the full version, the PAK files are inside Quake's ID1 folder on your computer.

Copy the _PAK0.PAK_ (and _PAK1.PAK_ if you own the full version) file to "_/apps/quake/ID1_" on your SD card.

You're now ready to open the game on The Homebrew Channel menu.

You can optionally install the Channel forwarder for your Wii System Menu _**(QuakeGXWii_Channel_Forwarder.wad, MD5: DC2BA822A20D9E813D0F37C2AD77F66F)**_  with your preferred WAD manager. It points to "_/apps/quake_" on your SD card.
